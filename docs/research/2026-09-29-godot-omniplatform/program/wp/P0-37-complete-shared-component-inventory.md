## Consolidation 2026-10-07

Registered by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) as **CQF-07** in [Track B, Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on)](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#b-foundations-code-quality-the-feature-tracks-build-on).

- UX rows absorbed (`uxRows` in `backlog-changes.json`): UX-11.
- UX rows that name this package: UX-49 (parked: portal on the shared kit beyond P0-37; revive when P0-37's inventory lands and a portal page needs a missing component).

## Approved plans (2026-10-08)

These approved plans change this package. Where they differ from the text below, they win.

- [docs plan](../../../2026-10-08-docs/README.md) §10 amendment 9: every component that components.md §7 lists for the docs stays renderable without the console's router, stores or query client, and keeps its class constants in `ui/classes.ts`.

## Goal

Complete the shared component inventory, as scoped below. Done when every acceptance criterion holds and the green gate passes.

## Why

Filed by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) (2026-10-07) as **CQF-07** in [Track B, Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on)](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#b-foundations-code-quality-the-feature-tracks-build-on). The decision record is [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md); the crosswalk from its working ids to graph ids is at the end of [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#crosswalk-integrationmd-ids-to-registered-ids). Evidence: [`audits/cq-frontend.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/cq-frontend.md).

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` (always), and the skill that applies, if any.
- [Track B, Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on)](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#b-foundations-code-quality-the-feature-tracks-build-on): the package's row, the track's dependencies and exit criteria, and the six cross-track rules at the top.
- [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md), for **CQF-07**.
- [`audits/cq-frontend.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/cq-frontend.md), for file and line evidence.

## Scope

**In:**

- One CommandPalette, AccountMenu/Avatar, BootScreen, Section (codemod SectionCard and hand-rolled cards, then a lint test), ProductMark (accent via resolveAccent), TokenList, ReleaseNotes, CheckRow/PrereqList, useMediaQuery/useFirstLoad/recents/lib/storage, PlatformGlyphs and KeyField/KeyMask in ui/. Absorbs UX-11 (pill and copy sweeps).

**Out** (and where it belongs instead):

- Work owned by the packages in the Depends on and Unblocks rows, and the rest of Track B (→ the ids in [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md)).

## Design notes

- Working id **CQF-07**; DX consolidation B: Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on).
- No new copies (tracks.md rule 4): build on the one mechanism this plan names, never beside it.

## Steps

1. Verify this brief against the code (the code is the fact) and record any correction here, in the same branch.
2. Implement the scope; run the green gate; hand off.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Each listed component exists once in ui/
- [ ] Lint refuses hand-rolled cards
- [ ] The green gate passes (`AGENTS.md`), including any drift gate this work package touches.

## Verify

```sh
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm --filter @polaris-key/admin test
```

Then the full green gate in `AGENTS.md`.

## Hand-off

What downstream work packages rely on from this one is named in their briefs (the Unblocks row). The role agent sets `--set P0-37 in-review` when it hands off. After review, the lead adds the last commit of the PR:
`node docs/research/2026-09-29-godot-omniplatform/program/check.mjs --set P0-37 done`.
