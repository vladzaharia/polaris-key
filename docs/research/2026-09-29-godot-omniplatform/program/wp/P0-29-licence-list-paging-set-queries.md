## Consolidation 2026-10-07

Registered by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) as **CQW-15** in [Track B, Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on)](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#b-foundations-code-quality-the-feature-tracks-build-on).

- UX rows that name this package: UX-36 (parked: bulk licence actions; revive with the first bulk request (P0-29's paging is its base)).

## Goal

Licence list paging and set queries, as scoped below. Done when every acceptance criterion holds and the green gate passes.

## Why

Filed by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) (2026-10-07) as **CQW-15** in [Track B, Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on)](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#b-foundations-code-quality-the-feature-tracks-build-on). The decision record is [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) (§3.1, §3.2, §4.2, §4.3); the crosswalk from its working ids to graph ids is at the end of [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#crosswalk-integrationmd-ids-to-registered-ids). Evidence: [`audits/cq-worker-services.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/cq-worker-services.md).

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` (always), and the skill that applies, if any.
- [Track B, Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on)](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#b-foundations-code-quality-the-feature-tracks-build-on): the package's row, the track's dependencies and exit criteria, and the six cross-track rules at the top.
- [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) §3.1, §3.2, §4.2, §4.3, for **CQW-15**.
- [`audits/cq-worker-services.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/cq-worker-services.md), for file and line evidence.

## Scope

**In:**

- GET .../license/licenses?cursor&limit keyset on activated_at DESC, id DESC; batch keys, devices, profiles, subjects and device-limit reads into per-page IN queries; remove the per-row resolveMergedPayload (services/license/admin/licenses.ts:299); console paging.

**Out** (and where it belongs instead):

- Work owned by the packages in the Depends on and Unblocks rows, and the rest of Track B (→ the ids in [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md)).

## Design notes

- Working id **CQW-15**; DX consolidation B: Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on).
- No new copies (tracks.md rule 4): build on the one mechanism this plan names, never beside it.

## Brand transition (2026-10-09)

Applied from the brand and transition integration ([Brand transition decisions](../BRAND-TRANSITION.md)). This section wins over the text below where they differ.

- (Moved here because LX-30 is done.) The Licenses list uses the single workbench band (holder segments, search, facets, Columns and Export), keeps 56 px rows, and on tablet (640-1023) scrolls sideways inside the labelled region with the License column sticky. The phone keeps the current mockup (title, description, New license full width, Create keys in bulk and More on one row, compact cards of about 140 px), not the guide's. (admin-1-22)

## Steps

1. Verify this brief against the code (the code is the fact) and record any correction here, in the same branch.
2. Implement the scope; run the green gate; hand off.

## Screen acceptance (brand transition, 2026-10-09)

Done when every row holds for each screen and state this package ships, checked in the real runtime
(not mockups; native kits on device or simulator), with evidence paths in the PR. A row that cannot
apply says why in one line. One home: EXPERIENCE.md §7.3; kits also follow DL1–DL18.

- [ ] Keyboard: tab order follows reading order; focus always visible (DL9); no trap outside a modal;
      Escape or Cancel backs out of every overlay and step; focus returns to the opener (or the heading
      when it is gone); a route change changes the URL and moves focus to the h1, an inline mutation
      changes neither.
- [ ] Screen readers: landmarks and exactly one h1; every icon-only control named; help and errors
      linked (aria-describedby); one polite announcement per change, none while typing; tables use
      th with scope; status is a word and an icon, never colour alone.
- [ ] Sizing: this surface's UI-KITS §7.1 rows plus 200 % text and 400 % zoom (320 CSS px reflow) with
      no page-level sideways scroll; a dense table scrolls only inside a labelled, focusable region;
      targets ≥ 44 px on customer and touch surfaces, ≥ 24 px with separation in the console.
- [ ] Themes: dark and light; a custom product accent on a light and a dark ground (kits, hosted
      sign-in); forced-colors; prefers-contrast: more; reduced transparency; contrast measured on the render (text 4.5:1, UI 3:1) for every state colour in its service accent, both themes.
- [ ] States: loading (skeleton after the grace), first-run empty, filtered empty, permission refused,
      expired or stale, network and API error with Try again, partial failure, success; input survives a
      failed save; where the API sends expectedVersion, a changed-since-open conflict is named with
      Reload.
- [ ] Motion: tokens only; reduced motion is an instant swap and the outcome still reads; errors appear
      without moving content; progress is real (no invented percentage, nothing loops after a failure);
      no celebration on refunds, revocation, removal, deletion or consent.
- [ ] Hierarchy and copy: one filled primary per state (neutral action ink in console, portal and hosted
      sign-in; the product accent in kits); focus, selected, hover, checked and context
      borders take the accent of the service the element references (data-service; -fg for
      text and edges, base for fills; a non-colour cue stays); status colours (success,
      warning, danger, info, signed) never become a service accent; copy from the catalog, each fact once; no decorative numbers or
      taglines; no text drawn over customer art.
- [ ] Native (kits): Dynamic Type or font scale at the 200 % row, VoiceOver or TalkBack, gamepad and
      D-pad focus, TV and title-safe insets, terminal keys with NO_COLOR, ascii and --json paths.
- [ ] pkey-ux-reviewer passes the built screens (BUILT mode).

## UX coverage (2026-10-09)

Generated from `ux-coverage.json` (read `ux-coverage.md` for the whole map). Do not edit this section by hand; change the coverage file.

- **Builds or backs 2 mockup item(s):** `licenses.list-states`, `licenses.list`.
- This package is the builder that carries the UX gate for the items above: the Screen acceptance block applies, and `pkey-ux-reviewer` must pass the built screens (record it with `--ux-review`).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Constant query count per page (test)
- [ ] Console list pages by cursor
- [ ] The green gate passes (`AGENTS.md`), including any drift gate this work package touches.

## Verify

```sh
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm --filter @polaris-key/worker test
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm gen transcripts --check
```

Then the full green gate in `AGENTS.md`.

## Hand-off

What downstream work packages rely on from this one is named in their briefs (the Unblocks row). The role agent sets `--set P0-29 in-review` when it hands off. After review, the lead adds the last commit of the PR:
`node docs/research/2026-09-29-godot-omniplatform/program/check.mjs --set P0-29 done`.
