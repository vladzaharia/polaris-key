## Consolidation 2026-10-07

Registered by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) as **IX-01b** in [Track F, Identity](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#f-identity).

## Goal

Accounts contract drops (release N+1), as scoped below. Done when every acceptance criterion holds and the green gate passes.

## Why

Filed by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) (2026-10-07) as **IX-01b** in [Track F, Identity](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#f-identity). The decision record is [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) (§3.2, §4.2); the crosswalk from its working ids to graph ids is at the end of [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#crosswalk-integrationmd-ids-to-registered-ids). Evidence: the [decision record](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) (no audit names **IX-01b**).

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` (always), and the skill that applies, if any.
- [Track F, Identity](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#f-identity): the package's row, the track's dependencies and exit criteria, and the six cross-track rules at the top.
- [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) §3.2, §4.2, for **IX-01b**.

## Scope

**In:**

- One release after I-28, after a production check that nothing read or wrote them: drop portal_accounts, portal_account_emails, portal_account_identities and portal_license_links with their \_v views (lead-numbered migration, replay-safe, a down script in scripts/rollback/); accounts.terms_json stays dormant unless D1 can drop the column without a table rebuild; P0-24 ledger row closed.

**Out** (and where it belongs instead):

- Work owned by the packages in the Depends on and Unblocks rows, and the rest of Track F (→ the ids in [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md)).

## Design notes

- Working id **IX-01b**; DX consolidation F: Identity.
- D1 migration (`mig`): name the file `00XX_<name>.sql`; the lead assigns the number at merge. Contracts take two releases (tracks.md rule 5): replay-safe, safe for the Worker still serving during the deploy, with a down script in `scripts/rollback/`.
- No new copies (tracks.md rule 4): build on the one mechanism this plan names, never beside it.

## Steps

1. Verify this brief against the code (the code is the fact) and record any correction here, in the same branch.
2. Implement the scope; run the green gate; hand off.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Production check recorded before the drop
- [ ] Down script restores the empty tables
- [ ] The green gate passes (`AGENTS.md`), including any drift gate this work package touches.

## Verify

```sh
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm --filter @polaris-key/worker test
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm gen transcripts --check
```

Then the full green gate in `AGENTS.md`.

## Hand-off

What downstream work packages rely on from this one is named in their briefs (the Unblocks row). The role agent sets `--set I-28b in-review` when it hands off. After review, the lead adds the last commit of the PR:
`node docs/research/2026-09-29-godot-omniplatform/program/check.mjs --set I-28b done`.
