## Consolidation 2026-10-07

Registered by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) as **DC-04** in [Track H, Distribution channels, storefronts and commerce](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#h-distribution-channels-storefronts-and-commerce).

- UX rows absorbed (`uxRows` in `backlog-changes.json`): UX-54.

## Goal

Console IA: Distribution and Commerce groups, as scoped below. Done when every acceptance criterion holds and the green gate passes.

## Why

Filed by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) (2026-10-07) as **DC-04** in [Track H, Distribution channels, storefronts and commerce](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#h-distribution-channels-storefronts-and-commerce). The decision record is [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) (§3.1, §4.2, §4.3); the crosswalk from its working ids to graph ids is at the end of [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#crosswalk-integrationmd-ids-to-registered-ids). Evidence: [`audits/release-distribution.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/release-distribution.md).

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` (always), and the skill that applies, if any.
- [Track H, Distribution channels, storefronts and commerce](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#h-distribution-channels-storefronts-and-commerce): the package's row, the track's dependencies and exit criteria, and the six cross-track rules at the top.
- [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) §3.1, §4.2, §4.3, for **DC-04**.
- [`audits/release-distribution.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/release-distribution.md), for file and line evidence.

## Scope

**In:**

- Data-driven nav: Distribution has Overview, Rollouts, Health, Channels (one entry per relevant channel) and Packages; Commerce has one Storefronts overview (each row opens that channel's page on Sales), Offers and Purchases, shown while Licensing is on and a storefront is connectable; Matrix, Outlets & feeds, the Storefronts grid, Listing, App Store, Commerce and Outlet credentials retire through LEGACY_REDIRECTS, and Distribution -> Access redirects to the product Access page (P2-10); palette and docsLinks updated. RBAC areas are declared on routes (ST-28), so moving a nav item changes nobody's access. Absorbs UX-54.

**Out** (and where it belongs instead):

- Work owned by the packages in the Depends on and Unblocks rows, and the rest of Track H (→ the ids in [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md)).

## Design notes

- Working id **DC-04**; DX consolidation H: Distribution channels, storefronts and commerce.
- No new copies (tracks.md rule 4): build on the one mechanism this plan names, never beside it.

## Steps

1. Verify this brief against the code (the code is the fact) and record any correction here, in the same branch.
2. Implement the scope; run the green gate; hand off.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Eight legacy items redirect
- [ ] Only channels the product can use appear
- [ ] The ST-28 area drift gate passes unchanged
- [ ] The green gate passes (`AGENTS.md`), including any drift gate this work package touches.

## Verify

```sh
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm --filter @polaris-key/admin test
```

Then the full green gate in `AGENTS.md`.

## Hand-off

What downstream work packages rely on from this one is named in their briefs (the Unblocks row). The role agent sets `--set A-21 in-review` when it hands off. After review, the lead adds the last commit of the PR:
`node docs/research/2026-09-29-godot-omniplatform/program/check.mjs --set A-21 done`.
