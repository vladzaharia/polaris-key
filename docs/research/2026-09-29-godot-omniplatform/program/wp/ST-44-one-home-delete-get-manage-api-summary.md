## Consolidation 2026-10-07

Registered by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) as **OB-08** in [Track C, Products, onboarding and Integration](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#c-products-onboarding-and-integration).

- UX rows absorbed (`uxRows` in `backlog-changes.json`): UX-12, UX-67.

## Goal

One Home; delete GET /manage/api/summary; slim product list, as scoped below. Done when every acceptance criterion holds and the green gate passes.

## Why

Filed by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) (2026-10-07) as **OB-08** in [Track C, Products, onboarding and Integration](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#c-products-onboarding-and-integration). The decision record is [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) (§3.2, §4.2, §4.3); the crosswalk from its working ids to graph ids is at the end of [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#crosswalk-integrationmd-ids-to-registered-ids). Evidence: [`audits/products-onboarding.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/products-onboarding.md), [`audits/rbac-admin.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/rbac-admin.md).

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` (always), and the skill that applies, if any.
- [Track C, Products, onboarding and Integration](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#c-products-onboarding-and-integration): the package's row, the track's dependencies and exit criteria, and the six cross-track rules at the top.
- [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) §3.2, §4.2, §4.3, for **OB-08**.
- [`audits/products-onboarding.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/products-onboarding.md), for file and line evidence.
- [`audits/rbac-admin.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/rbac-admin.md), for file and line evidence.

## Scope

**In:**

- Home with attention, Platform ready (UX-67) and product cards with a table toggle and facets; the Products page retires with a redirect; a server attention read GET /manage/api/attention (UX-12) composed from the descriptors' integration prerequisites and the health kinds, replacing attention.ts's client derivation from productSetupView and the summary; delete GET /manage/api/summary, admin/lib/summary.ts, useSummary, qk.summary and its 14 invalidations, and mark ADMIN.md's A-8 fleet facts dropped; a slim GET /products projection; the 'Setup complete' facet becomes Verified.

**Out** (and where it belongs instead):

- Work owned by the packages in the Depends on and Unblocks rows, and the rest of Track C (→ the ids in [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md)).

## Design notes

- Working id **OB-08**; DX consolidation C: Products, onboarding and Integration.
- No new copies (tracks.md rule 4): build on the one mechanism this plan names, never beside it.

## Steps

1. Verify this brief against the code (the code is the fact) and record any correction here, in the same branch.
2. Implement the scope; run the green gate; hand off.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Summary route and hooks deleted (OpenAPI, routeCoverage); ADMIN.md A-8 marked dropped
- [ ] One Home for cards and table; attention comes from one server read
- [ ] The card stays ST-36's name/slug header plus service icons, pips on phones (no added facts)
- [ ] The green gate passes (`AGENTS.md`), including any drift gate this work package touches.

## Verify

```sh
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm --filter @polaris-key/admin test
```

Then the full green gate in `AGENTS.md`.

## Hand-off

What downstream work packages rely on from this one is named in their briefs (the Unblocks row). The role agent sets `--set ST-44 in-review` when it hands off. After review, the lead adds the last commit of the PR:
`node docs/research/2026-09-29-godot-omniplatform/program/check.mjs --set ST-44 done`.
