## Consolidation 2026-10-07

> **Parked 2026-10-07 (DX consolidation).** Optional and `deferred`, so `--ready` and `--critical`
> skip it. Revive when a product targets visionOS. Re-read this brief against the code before reviving it.

The [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) records this package as **parked** in [`backlog-changes.json`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/backlog-changes.json); the [decision record](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) has the reasoning. This section wins over the text below where they differ.

> visionOS kit. Revive when a product targets visionOS.

- Optional now (was required).

## Owner direction (2026-10-08)

- **Two implementation paths.** An integrator drops in the kit or builds their own UI on the SDK. The in-app experience leads with the drop-in kit and links to the docs for integrating directly with your own UI. The docs present both paths.

## Design language v2 (2026-10-08)

This package follows the [design language](../../../../design/UI-KITS.md#design-language-v2-2026-10-08) (rules DL1–DL18). Its row of the [application matrix](../../../../design/UI-KITS-LANGUAGE-MATRIX.md):

- **Rules:** DL1–DL16 and DL18 (DL14: links only; DL17: ornaments sit outside the window instead of insets).
- **In this kit:** No built precedent: evaluate on the simulator before committing to a look. Starting points: the window's glass is always the system material (`glassBackgroundEffect`), so the ambient is off and `polaris-key` shows only in the accent, type and identity; banners (grace, update) are ornaments on the window's bottom edge; gaze hover (`.hoverEffect`) is the DL9 focus signal; targets are at least 60 pt; the default window is landscape, so DL1's two panes apply to the gate. Evaluate whether Rubik at 400 reads on glass, where system text is heavier, and record what "both schemes" means without a light and dark switch (for example two simulated environments).
- **Minimum check:** Simulator snapshots at the default window size and a narrow, tall window, in a light and a dark environment.
- **Acceptance:** the matrix rows above pass, and a UX review (`pkey-ux-reviewer`) of the built screens gives each a quality verdict of good or better.

## Screen acceptance (brand transition, 2026-10-09)

Done when every row holds for each screen and state this package ships, checked in the real runtime
(not mockups; native kits on device or simulator), with evidence paths in the PR. A row that cannot
apply says why in one line. One home: EXPERIENCE.md §7.3; kits also follow DL1–DL18.

- [ ] Keyboard: tab order follows reading order; focus always visible (DL9); no trap outside a modal;
      Escape or Cancel backs out of every overlay and step; focus returns to the opener (or the heading
      when it is gone); a route change changes the URL and moves focus to the h1, an inline mutation
      changes neither.
- [ ] Screen readers: landmarks and exactly one h1; every icon-only control named; help and errors
      linked (aria-describedby); one polite announcement per change, none while typing; tables use
      th with scope; status is a word and an icon, never colour alone.
- [ ] Sizing: this surface's UI-KITS §7.1 rows plus 200 % text and 400 % zoom (320 CSS px reflow) with
      no page-level sideways scroll; a dense table scrolls only inside a labelled, focusable region;
      targets ≥ 44 px on customer and touch surfaces, ≥ 24 px with separation in the console.
- [ ] Themes: dark and light; a custom product accent on a light and a dark ground (kits, hosted
      sign-in); forced-colors; prefers-contrast: more; reduced transparency; contrast measured on the
      render (text 4.5:1, UI 3:1).
- [ ] States: loading (skeleton after the grace), first-run empty, filtered empty, permission refused,
      expired or stale, network and API error with Try again, partial failure, success; input survives a
      failed save; where the API sends expectedVersion, a changed-since-open conflict is named with
      Reload.
- [ ] Motion: tokens only; reduced motion is an instant swap and the outcome still reads; errors appear
      without moving content; progress is real (no invented percentage, nothing loops after a failure);
      no celebration on refunds, revocation, removal, deletion or consent.
- [ ] Hierarchy and copy: one filled primary per state; the section accent marks context only, never
      success, warning or failure; copy from the catalog, each fact once; no decorative numbers or
      taglines; no text drawn over customer art.
- [ ] Native (kits): Dynamic Type or font scale at the 200 % row, VoiceOver or TalkBack, gamepad and
      D-pad focus, TV and title-safe insets, terminal keys with NO_COLOR, ascii and --json paths.
- [ ] pkey-ux-reviewer passes the built screens (BUILT mode).

## Goal

The visionOS surface of the Swift kit exists, reuses the SwiftUI views and presentation core with no second implementation, and is baselined in both themes.

## Why

visionOS is a should row of §5.1; SP-08 adds the canonical `visionos` platform value the SDK must send. The spec is [`docs/design/UI-KITS.md`](../../../../design/UI-KITS.md); its "Owner decisions (2026-10-05)" header wins over the sections below it.

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` (always) and `CLAUDE.md`.
- [UI-KITS.md](../../../../design/UI-KITS.md) §1.4 (Apple rows), §5.1 Swift rows, §7.1
- The UK-07 kit

## Scope

**In:**

- Glass windows, ornaments for banners, hover effects.
- `.visionOS(.v2)` in `Package.swift`; CI job and snapshots.

**Out** (and where it belongs instead):

- A second implementation of any screen (never).

## Design notes

- Presentation comes only through the core's `ProductIdentity` seam from the SDK (HA-13, HA-14). This package does not depend on them: it tests the default with a fake source, and the real accessor plugs in without a kit change (UK-41 verifies it).
- Launch locales are English plus `de`, `fr`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `zh-Hans`; there is no RTL locale, so no RTL baselines, but layouts stay RTL-safe.

## Brand transition (2026-10-09)

Applied from the brand and transition integration ([Brand transition decisions](../BRAND-TRANSITION.md)). This section wins over the text below where they differ.

- visionOS: ornaments carry banners only (GraceBanner, UpdateProgress); the Welcome extras stay as quiet links in the window; no ambient inside system glass; keep the circular icon and the two-pane gate. (sdk-a-17)

## Steps

1. Headless layer first: the models or controllers, running the UK-02b fixtures.
2. Styled parts, then the drop-in flow, against the mockups.
3. Baselines in both themes, the lint, the sample and the docs pages.
4. Design review against the mockups; record it in the PR.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every §4.1 component in scope ships in all three layers of §1.3: (a) the drop-in flow, (b) styled parts with the kit's restyle hooks (§3.2), and (c) the headless model.
- [ ] With an empty theme the kit renders the Polaris Key look (§1.1) in the product's accent; `preset: "native"` restyles it to the host (§3.4); every §3.1 theme field is honoured.
- [ ] Product identity resolves integrator → SDK presentation source → bundle → derived accent → ink (§1.2). A test with a fake presentation source (accent, `accentDark`, verified icon) renders the product accent and icon with **zero integrator code**; the kit has no discovery fetch or icon cache of its own (owner decision: one path, via HA-13/HA-14).
- [ ] Every visible string is a catalog key from UK-02a in the launch locales; the cross-kit string lint (UK-15) passes.
- [ ] Screenshot baselines exist for every fixture component × state (UK-02b) in **both dark and light**, at the sizes and variants of §7.1 for this kit, committed lossless under `sdks/swift/Tests/PolarisKeyUISnapshotTests/__Snapshots__/`; a changed baseline fails CI until re-recorded with the reason in the commit.
- [ ] The §7.3 modernity lint passes on this kit, including the RTL-safe layout rule (no physical left/right; no RTL baselines are required).
- [ ] The §4.4 accessibility checks pass on the same renders.
- [ ] The sample `examples/ui/swiftui/ (visionOS target)` runs against the fixture adapters with no live Worker and with `--live` (§6.1).
- [ ] The kit's framework page and its tab on each component page exist in the docs `build/ui/` section (UK-16 scaffold); the kit README is install + one-line flow + link.
- [ ] A design review against the mockups (the Apple boards (`ios.html`, `desktop.html`) and the UK-01 additions) is recorded in the PR (§7.4); any disagreement between mockup and spec is fixed first.
- [ ] `parity.json` for this SDK records the `ui.*` rows this kit proves (UK-02b ids), with snapshot plus fixture-run proofs.
- [ ] The acceptance in "Design language v2 (2026-10-08)" above holds.
- [ ] The green gate passes (AGENTS.md), including every drift gate listed in the header.
