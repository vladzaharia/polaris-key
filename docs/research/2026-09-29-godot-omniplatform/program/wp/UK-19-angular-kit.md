## Consolidation 2026-10-07

> **Parked 2026-10-07 (DX consolidation).** Optional and `deferred`, so `--ready` and `--critical`
> skip it. Revive condition (the note): Angular kit package; a UK-31 recipe until an adopter ships on Angular. Re-read this brief against the code before reviving it.

The [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) records this package as **parked** in [`backlog-changes.json`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/backlog-changes.json); the [decision record](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) has the reasoning. This section wins over the text below where they differ.

> Angular kit package; a UK-31 recipe until an adopter ships on Angular.

- Optional now (was required).

## Owner direction (2026-10-08)

- **Two implementation paths.** An integrator drops in the kit or builds their own UI on the SDK. The in-app experience leads with the drop-in kit and links to the docs for integrating directly with your own UI. The docs present both paths.

## Design language v2 (2026-10-08)

This package follows the [design language](../../../../design/UI-KITS.md#design-language-v2-2026-10-08) (rules DL1–DL18). Its row of the [application matrix](../../../../design/UI-KITS-LANGUAGE-MATRIX.md):

- **Rules:** DL1–DL18 (DL14: links only; the web browses, so no QR), inherited from UK-04.
- **In this kit:** Angular standalone wrappers over the elements, adding no layout. Parts, slots and focus pass through. Focus moves run after render (`afterNextRender`), so zoneless change detection never delays them; the router never takes focus from the kit; a signals service carries the theme.
- **Minimum check:** Phone portrait, phone landscape and desktop in both schemes and both presets, pixel-equal to UK-04's baselines for the same states.
- **Acceptance:** the matrix rows above pass, and a UX review (`pkey-ux-reviewer`) of the built screens gives each a quality verdict of good or better.

## Screen acceptance (brand transition, 2026-10-09)

Done when every row holds for each screen and state this package ships, checked in the real runtime
(not mockups; native kits on device or simulator), with evidence paths in the PR. A row that cannot
apply says why in one line. One home: EXPERIENCE.md §7.3; kits also follow DL1–DL18.

- [ ] Keyboard: tab order follows reading order; focus always visible (DL9); no trap outside a modal;
      Escape or Cancel backs out of every overlay and step; focus returns to the opener (or the heading
      when it is gone); a route change changes the URL and moves focus to the h1, an inline mutation
      changes neither.
- [ ] Screen readers: landmarks and exactly one h1; every icon-only control named; help and errors
      linked (aria-describedby); one polite announcement per change, none while typing; tables use
      th with scope; status is a word and an icon, never colour alone.
- [ ] Sizing: this surface's UI-KITS §7.1 rows plus 200 % text and 400 % zoom (320 CSS px reflow) with
      no page-level sideways scroll; a dense table scrolls only inside a labelled, focusable region;
      targets ≥ 44 px on customer and touch surfaces, ≥ 24 px with separation in the console.
- [ ] Themes: dark and light; a custom product accent on a light and a dark ground (kits, hosted
      sign-in); forced-colors; prefers-contrast: more; reduced transparency; contrast measured on the render (text 4.5:1, UI 3:1) for every state colour in its service accent, both themes.
- [ ] States: loading (skeleton after the grace), first-run empty, filtered empty, permission refused,
      expired or stale, network and API error with Try again, partial failure, success; input survives a
      failed save; where the API sends expectedVersion, a changed-since-open conflict is named with
      Reload.
- [ ] Motion: tokens only; reduced motion is an instant swap and the outcome still reads; errors appear
      without moving content; progress is real (no invented percentage, nothing loops after a failure);
      no celebration on refunds, revocation, removal, deletion or consent.
- [ ] Hierarchy and copy: one filled primary per state (neutral action ink in console, portal and hosted
      sign-in; the product accent in kits); focus, selected, hover, checked and context
      borders take the accent of the service the element references (data-service; -fg for
      text and edges, base for fills; a non-colour cue stays); status colours (success,
      warning, danger, info, signed) never become a service accent; copy from the catalog, each fact once; no decorative numbers or
      taglines; no text drawn over customer art.
- [ ] Native (kits): Dynamic Type or font scale at the 200 % row, VoiceOver or TalkBack, gamepad and
      D-pad focus, TV and title-safe insets, terminal keys with NO_COLOR, ascii and --json paths.
- [ ] pkey-ux-reviewer passes the built screens (BUILT mode).

## Goal

A Angular app gates itself in its framework's idiom, with every element's parts and slots passed through and typed.

## Why

Angular is a should row of §5.1: the elements already work there, and this package makes them idiomatic and typed. The spec is [`docs/design/UI-KITS.md`](../../../../design/UI-KITS.md); its "Owner decisions (2026-10-05)" header wins over the sections below it.

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` (always) and `CLAUDE.md`.
- [UI-KITS.md](../../../../design/UI-KITS.md) §3.2 (Vue, Svelte, Angular row), §5.1, §6.1
- `packages/elements/` (UK-04)

## Scope

**In:**

- `@polaris-key/angular`: a signals service and standalone components wrapping the elements.
- Theme provider in the framework's idiom (`providePolarisKey` / `setPolarisKeyTheme`).
- Sample `examples/ui/angular/`.

**Out** (and where it belongs instead):

- New components: none; everything renders through the elements.

## Design notes

- Presentation comes only through the core's `ProductIdentity` seam from the SDK (HA-13, HA-14). This package does not depend on them: it tests the default with a fake source, and the real accessor plugs in without a kit change (UK-41 verifies it).
- Launch locales are English plus `de`, `fr`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `zh-Hans`; there is no RTL locale, so no RTL baselines, but layouts stay RTL-safe.

## Steps

1. Headless layer first: the models or controllers, running the UK-02b fixtures.
2. Styled parts, then the drop-in flow, against the mockups.
3. Baselines in both themes, the lint, the sample and the docs pages.
4. Design review against the mockups; record it in the PR.

## UX coverage (2026-10-09)

Generated from `ux-coverage.json` (read `ux-coverage.md` for the whole map). Do not edit this section by hand; change the coverage file.

- **Builds or backs 1 mockup item(s):** `kitboard:web:angular-kit`.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every §4.1 component in scope ships in all three layers of §1.3: (a) the drop-in flow, (b) styled parts with the kit's restyle hooks (§3.2), and (c) the headless model.
- [ ] With an empty theme the kit renders the Polaris Key look (§1.1) in the product's accent; `preset: "native"` restyles it to the host (§3.4); every §3.1 theme field is honoured.
- [ ] Product identity resolves integrator → SDK presentation source → bundle → derived accent → ink (§1.2). A test with a fake presentation source (accent, `accentDark`, verified icon) renders the product accent and icon with **zero integrator code**; the kit has no discovery fetch or icon cache of its own (owner decision: one path, via HA-13/HA-14).
- [ ] Every visible string is a catalog key from UK-02a in the launch locales; the cross-kit string lint (UK-15) passes.
- [ ] Screenshot baselines exist for every fixture component × state (UK-02b) in **both dark and light**, at the sizes and variants of §7.1 for this kit, committed lossless under `packages/angular/test/visual/__screenshots__/`; a changed baseline fails CI until re-recorded with the reason in the commit.
- [ ] The §7.3 modernity lint passes on this kit, including the RTL-safe layout rule (no physical left/right; no RTL baselines are required).
- [ ] The §4.4 accessibility checks pass on the same renders.
- [ ] The sample `examples/ui/angular/` runs against the fixture adapters with no live Worker and with `--live` (§6.1).
- [ ] The kit's framework page and its tab on each component page exist in the docs `build/ui/` section (UK-16 scaffold); the kit README is install + one-line flow + link.
- [ ] A design review against the mockups (`web.html`) is recorded in the PR (§7.4); any disagreement between mockup and spec is fixed first.
- [ ] `parity.json` for this SDK records the `ui.*` rows this kit proves (UK-02b ids), with snapshot plus fixture-run proofs.
- [ ] The acceptance in "Design language v2 (2026-10-08)" above holds.
- [ ] The green gate passes (AGENTS.md), including every drift gate listed in the header.

## Verify

```sh
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm --filter @polaris-key/angular test
```

## Hand-off

None.

The role agent sets `--set UK-19 in-review` when it hands off. After review, the lead adds the last
commit of the PR: `node docs/research/2026-09-29-godot-omniplatform/program/check.mjs --set UK-19 done`.
