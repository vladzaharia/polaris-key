## Consolidation 2026-10-07

Registered by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) as **OB-09** in [Track C, Products, onboarding and Integration](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#c-products-onboarding-and-integration).

- UX rows absorbed (`uxRows` in `backlog-changes.json`): UX-09, UX-13, UX-14, UX-26.

## Approved plans (2026-10-08)

These approved plans change this package. Where they differ from the text below, they win.

- [`plans/ST-28.md`](../plans/ST-28.md) §10: filtering through `useCan`.

## Goal

Platform and Product sidebar contexts, as scoped below. Done when every acceptance criterion holds and the green gate passes.

## Why

Filed by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) (2026-10-07) as **OB-09** in [Track C, Products, onboarding and Integration](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#c-products-onboarding-and-integration). The decision record is [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) (§3.2); the crosswalk from its working ids to graph ids is at the end of [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#crosswalk-integrationmd-ids-to-registered-ids). Evidence: [`audits/backlog-sweep.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/backlog-sweep.md), [`audits/products-onboarding.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/products-onboarding.md), [`audits/rbac-admin.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/rbac-admin.md).

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` (always), and the skill that applies, if any.
- [Track C, Products, onboarding and Integration](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#c-products-onboarding-and-integration): the package's row, the track's dependencies and exit criteria, and the six cross-track rules at the top.
- [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) §3.2, for **OB-09**.
- [`audits/backlog-sweep.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/backlog-sweep.md), for file and line evidence.
- [`audits/products-onboarding.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/products-onboarding.md), for file and line evidence.
- [`audits/rbac-admin.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/rbac-admin.md), for file and line evidence.

## Scope

**In:**

- Context header with a switcher; Platform context (Home, Members, Connections, Settings, Packages, Status, Activity); Product context (Overview, Integration, Access, Devices, Users, Activity, the five features, Settings hub); requires flags hide idle one-time pages; permission filtering through useCan; Override migration out of the nav; absorbs the UX-09, UX-13, UX-14 and UX-26 sweeps. Areas are not tied to this nav (ST-28).

**Out** (and where it belongs instead):

- Work owned by the packages in the Depends on and Unblocks rows, and the rest of Track C (→ the ids in [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md)).

## Design notes

- Working id **OB-09**; DX consolidation C: Products, onboarding and Integration.
- No new copies (tracks.md rule 4): build on the one mechanism this plan names, never beside it.

## Steps

1. Verify this brief against the code (the code is the fact) and record any correction here, in the same branch.
2. Implement the scope; run the green gate; hand off.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Platform pages never appear in the product sidebar
- [ ] Nav items hidden by permission, never dead-ended
- [ ] The green gate passes (`AGENTS.md`), including any drift gate this work package touches.

## Verify

```sh
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm --filter @polaris-key/admin test
```

Then the full green gate in `AGENTS.md`.

## Hand-off

What downstream work packages rely on from this one is named in their briefs (the Unblocks row). The role agent sets `--set ST-45 in-review` when it hands off. After review, the lead adds the last commit of the PR:
`node docs/research/2026-09-29-godot-omniplatform/program/check.mjs --set ST-45 done`.
