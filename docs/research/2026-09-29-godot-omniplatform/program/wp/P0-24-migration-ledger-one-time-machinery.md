## Consolidation 2026-10-07

Registered by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) as **CQW-10** in [Track B, Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on)](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#b-foundations-code-quality-the-feature-tracks-build-on).

- Owner 2026-10-07: no compatibility windows (`tracks.md` rule 6). The ledger keeps only the break-glass `ADMIN_OIDC_*` window, paths that native binaries already on end-user machines call (DJDL's desktop builds, the permanent alias routes; removed once DJDL has shipped a build on 0.9) and the two-release DB contracts. There is no SDK, CLI, Action, cookie-mode, `PKEY_ADMIN_COOKIE` or Pocket ID env window, and manifest fields are removed, not deprecated.

## Goal

Migration ledger and one-time machinery sunset, as scoped below. Done when every acceptance criterion holds and the green gate passes.

## Why

Filed by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) (2026-10-07) as **CQW-10** in [Track B, Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on)](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#b-foundations-code-quality-the-feature-tracks-build-on). The decision record is [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) (§3.2, §4.3, §6); the crosswalk from its working ids to graph ids is at the end of [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#crosswalk-integrationmd-ids-to-registered-ids). Evidence: [`audits/cq-worker-core.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/cq-worker-core.md), [`audits/cq-worker-services.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/cq-worker-services.md).

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` (always), and the skill that applies, if any.
- [Track B, Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on)](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#b-foundations-code-quality-the-feature-tracks-build-on): the package's row, the track's dependencies and exit criteria, and the six cross-track rules at the top.
- [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) §3.2, §4.3, §6, for **CQW-10**.
- [`audits/cq-worker-core.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/cq-worker-core.md), for file and line evidence.
- [`audits/cq-worker-services.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/cq-worker-services.md), for file and line evidence.

## Scope

**In:**

- A RUNBOOK migration ledger listing every expand/contract pair with owner and exit criterion: U-03 (closed by U-27, U-27b), the ST-01c settings backfill, I-17's platform-IdP claim, LX-08's catch-up, LX-16 and LX-16b, I-28 and I-28b, P0-28 and P0-28b, A-27 and A-27b, PS-11, ST-25; the licensing rollback ladder (0105_licensing.down.sql valid only before LX-35's migration; each later migration ships its own down script); every deprecation window in calendar days with its production exit fact (break-glass, PKEY_ADMIN_COOKIE, SDK and Action aliases, Pocket ID env override); P0-49's job reports; delete the settings backfill runner, routes and console page once the owner has run it (owner step).

**Out** (and where it belongs instead):

- Work owned by the packages in the Depends on and Unblocks rows, and the rest of Track B (→ the ids in [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md)).

## Design notes

- Working id **CQW-10**; DX consolidation B: Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on).
- No new copies (tracks.md rule 4): build on the one mechanism this plan names, never beside it.

## Steps

1. Verify this brief against the code (the code is the fact) and record any correction here, in the same branch.
2. Implement the scope; run the green gate; hand off.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Ledger exists with an exit criterion per row
- [ ] Every window is stated in days with a production fact, never in releases
- [ ] Settings backfill code removed after the owner step
- [ ] The green gate passes (`AGENTS.md`), including any drift gate this work package touches.

## Verify

```sh
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm --filter @polaris-key/docs check:links
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm --filter @polaris-key/docs build
```

Then the full green gate in `AGENTS.md`.

## Hand-off

What downstream work packages rely on from this one is named in their briefs (the Unblocks row). The role agent sets `--set P0-24 in-review` when it hands off. After review, the lead adds the last commit of the PR:
`node docs/research/2026-09-29-godot-omniplatform/program/check.mjs --set P0-24 done`.
