## Goal

HTML5 exports use the elements for sign-in and paywall through `JavaScriptBridge`, matching the Godot kit's look.

## Why

A could row of §5.1. The spec is [`docs/design/UI-KITS.md`](../../../../design/UI-KITS.md); its "Owner decisions (2026-10-05)" header wins over the sections below it.

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` (always) and `CLAUDE.md`.
- [UI-KITS.md](../../../../design/UI-KITS.md) §5.1 Godot rows
- The UK-11 kit

## Scope

**In:**

- `JavaScriptBridge` overlay hosting `pk-*` elements for sign-in and paywall; Godot-dark theme passed through.

**Out** (and where it belongs instead):

- Changes to the runtime kit (→ UK-11).

## Design notes

- Presentation comes only through the core's `ProductIdentity` seam from the SDK (HA-13, HA-14). This package does not depend on them: it tests the default with a fake source, and the real accessor plugs in without a kit change (UK-41 verifies it).
- Launch locales are English plus `de`, `fr`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `zh-Hans`; there is no RTL locale, so no RTL baselines, but layouts stay RTL-safe.

## Steps

1. Headless layer first: the models or controllers, running the UK-02b fixtures.
2. Styled parts, then the drop-in flow, against the mockups.
3. Baselines in both themes, the lint, the sample and the docs pages.
4. Design review against the mockups; record it in the PR.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every §4.1 component in scope ships in all three layers of §1.3: (a) the drop-in flow, (b) styled parts with the kit's restyle hooks (§3.2), and (c) the headless model.
- [ ] With an empty theme the kit renders the Polaris Key look (§1.1) in the product's accent; `preset: "native"` restyles it to the host (§3.4); every §3.1 theme field is honoured.
- [ ] Product identity resolves integrator → SDK presentation source → bundle → derived accent → ink (§1.2). A test with a fake presentation source (accent, `accentDark`, verified icon) renders the product accent and icon with **zero integrator code**; the kit has no discovery fetch or icon cache of its own (owner decision: one path, via HA-13/HA-14).
- [ ] Every visible string is a catalog key from UK-02a in the launch locales; the cross-kit string lint (UK-15) passes.
- [ ] Screenshot baselines exist for every fixture component × state (UK-02b) in **both dark and light**, at the sizes and variants of §7.1 for this kit, committed lossless under `sdks/godot/tests/ui/snapshots/`; a changed baseline fails CI until re-recorded with the reason in the commit.
- [ ] The §7.3 modernity lint passes on this kit, including the RTL-safe layout rule (no physical left/right; no RTL baselines are required).
- [ ] The §4.4 accessibility checks pass on the same renders.
- [ ] The sample runs against the fixture adapters with no live Worker and with `--live` (§6.1).
- [ ] The kit's framework page and its tab on each component page exist in the docs `build/ui/` section (UK-16 scaffold); the kit README is install + one-line flow + link.
- [ ] A design review against the mockups is recorded in the PR (§7.4); any disagreement between mockup and spec is fixed first.
- [ ] `parity.json` for this SDK records the `ui.*` rows this kit proves (UK-02b ids), with snapshot plus fixture-run proofs.
- [ ] The green gate passes (AGENTS.md), including every drift gate listed in the header.

## Verify

```sh
sdks/godot/tools/run_tests.sh
```

## Hand-off

None.

The role agent sets `--set UK-37 in-review` when it hands off. After review, the lead adds the last
commit of the PR: `node docs/research/2026-09-29-godot-omniplatform/program/check.mjs --set UK-37 done`.
