## Consolidation 2026-10-07

Registered by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) as **UC-04** in [Track I, Packages, updates and packs](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#i-packages-updates-and-packs).

- Clears its entries in `packages/admin/test/copy.debt.json` (ST-37's console copy ledger).

## Goal

Updates page: updaters for shipped platforms with Verified status, as scoped below. Done when every acceptance criterion holds and the green gate passes.

## Why

Filed by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) (2026-10-07) as **UC-04** in [Track I, Packages, updates and packs](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#i-packages-updates-and-packs). The decision record is [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) (§3.1, §4.3, §4.4); the crosswalk from its working ids to graph ids is at the end of [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#crosswalk-integrationmd-ids-to-registered-ids). Evidence: [`audits/feeds-updates-packs.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/feeds-updates-packs.md).

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` (always), and the skill that applies, if any.
- [Track I, Packages, updates and packs](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#i-packages-updates-and-packs): the package's row, the track's dependencies and exit criteria, and the six cross-track rules at the top.
- [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) §3.1, §4.3, §4.4, for **UC-04**.
- [`audits/feeds-updates-packs.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/feeds-updates-packs.md), for file and line evidence.

## Scope

**In:**

- renderUpdaterSetup per shipped platform and channel (Sparkle, WinSparkle, Velopack, App Installer, zsync, the signed feed, Play in-app updates, the Godot updater); endpoints scoped to productPlatforms (A-20); Verified from update-health events is the Ship builds domain fact (updaters send no X-PKey-SDK, so no sighting exists); pkey release keys init --sparkle; the page is named Updates under Ship builds and its settings rows are reachable from the hub.

**Out** (and where it belongs instead):

- Work owned by the packages in the Depends on and Unblocks rows, and the rest of Track I (→ the ids in [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md)).

## Design notes

- Working id **UC-04**; DX consolidation I: Packages, updates and packs.
- No new copies (tracks.md rule 4): build on the one mechanism this plan names, never beside it.

## Screen acceptance (brand transition, 2026-10-09)

Done when every row holds for each screen and state this package ships, checked in the real runtime
(not mockups; native kits on device or simulator), with evidence paths in the PR. A row that cannot
apply says why in one line. One home: EXPERIENCE.md §7.3; kits also follow DL1–DL18.

- [ ] Keyboard: tab order follows reading order; focus always visible (DL9); no trap outside a modal;
      Escape or Cancel backs out of every overlay and step; focus returns to the opener (or the heading
      when it is gone); a route change changes the URL and moves focus to the h1, an inline mutation
      changes neither.
- [ ] Screen readers: landmarks and exactly one h1; every icon-only control named; help and errors
      linked (aria-describedby); one polite announcement per change, none while typing; tables use
      th with scope; status is a word and an icon, never colour alone.
- [ ] Sizing: this surface's UI-KITS §7.1 rows plus 200 % text and 400 % zoom (320 CSS px reflow) with
      no page-level sideways scroll; a dense table scrolls only inside a labelled, focusable region;
      targets ≥ 44 px on customer and touch surfaces, ≥ 24 px with separation in the console.
- [ ] Themes: dark and light; a custom product accent on a light and a dark ground (kits, hosted
      sign-in); forced-colors; prefers-contrast: more; reduced transparency; contrast measured on the render (text 4.5:1, UI 3:1) for every state colour in its service accent, both themes.
- [ ] States: loading (skeleton after the grace), first-run empty, filtered empty, permission refused,
      expired or stale, network and API error with Try again, partial failure, success; input survives a
      failed save; where the API sends expectedVersion, a changed-since-open conflict is named with
      Reload.
- [ ] Motion: tokens only; reduced motion is an instant swap and the outcome still reads; errors appear
      without moving content; progress is real (no invented percentage, nothing loops after a failure);
      no celebration on refunds, revocation, removal, deletion or consent.
- [ ] Hierarchy and copy: one filled primary per state (neutral action ink in console, portal and hosted
      sign-in; the product accent in kits); focus, selected, hover, checked and context
      borders take the accent of the service the element references (data-service; -fg for
      text and edges, base for fills; a non-colour cue stays); status colours (success,
      warning, danger, info, signed) never become a service accent; copy from the catalog, each fact once; no decorative numbers or
      taglines; no text drawn over customer art.
- [ ] Native (kits): Dynamic Type or font scale at the 200 % row, VoiceOver or TalkBack, gamepad and
      D-pad focus, TV and title-safe insets, terminal keys with NO_COLOR, ascii and --json paths.
- [ ] pkey-ux-reviewer passes the built screens (BUILT mode).

## Brand transition (2026-10-09)

Applied from the brand and transition integration ([Brand transition decisions](../BRAND-TRANSITION.md)). This section wins over the text below where they differ.

- The glossary word is 'Verified', not 'Wired' (packages/docs start/concepts.md): the title, scope and acceptance say Verified. A signature-failure state is a persistent card state (danger count on the Updates nav item, the card's what-went-wrong, how-to-fix and what-owners-must-do callout) that clears only when checks succeed again, never a toast. The page is named Updates under Ship builds (B5, Release cyan chrome). (admin-2-18)

## Steps

1. Verify this brief against the code (the code is the fact) and record any correction here, in the same branch.
2. Implement the scope; run the green gate; hand off.

## UX coverage (2026-10-09)

Generated from `ux-coverage.json` (read `ux-coverage.md` for the whole map). Do not edit this section by hand; change the coverage file.

- **Builds or backs 4 mockup item(s):** `products.integration`, `packages.updates-failing`, `packages.updates-godot`, `packages.updates`.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A Windows-only product sees no Sparkle setup
- [ ] Verified flips on the first update check from a shipped build
- [ ] Docs, in this PR ([docs plan](../../../2026-10-08-docs/README.md) §10): its part of `releases/release-tracks`, `updates/*`, `packs/*`; `help/beta`.
- [ ] The green gate passes (`AGENTS.md`), including any drift gate this work package touches.

## Verify

```sh
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm --filter @polaris-key/admin test
```

Then the full green gate in `AGENTS.md`.

## Hand-off

What downstream work packages rely on from this one is named in their briefs (the Unblocks row). The role agent sets `--set P2-11 in-review` when it hands off. After review, the lead adds the last commit of the PR:
`node docs/research/2026-09-29-godot-omniplatform/program/check.mjs --set P2-11 done`.
