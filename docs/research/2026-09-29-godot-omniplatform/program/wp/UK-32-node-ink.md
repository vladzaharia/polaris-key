## Consolidation 2026-10-07

> **Parked 2026-10-07 (DX consolidation).** Optional and `deferred`, so `--ready` and `--critical`
> skip it. Revive condition (the note): Ink components duplicate UK-14's terminal kit. Re-read this brief against the code before reviving it.

The [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) records this package as **parked** in [`backlog-changes.json`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/backlog-changes.json); the [decision record](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) has the reasoning. This section wins over the text below where they differ.

> Ink components duplicate UK-14's terminal kit.

## Goal

The Ink surface exists over the existing core, with no second state machine, and is baselined in both themes.

## Why

A could row of §5.1 for Node TUI hosts. The spec is [`docs/design/UI-KITS.md`](../../../../design/UI-KITS.md); its "Owner decisions (2026-10-05)" header wins over the sections below it.

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` (always) and `CLAUDE.md`.
- [UI-KITS.md](../../../../design/UI-KITS.md) §5.1 could rows
- The kit it extends

## Scope

**In:**

- Ink components for the gate, activation, device limit and update progress over the UK-14 commands and the stage core; goldens.

**Out** (and where it belongs instead):

- A second state machine (never).

## Design notes

- Presentation comes only through the core's `ProductIdentity` seam from the SDK (HA-13, HA-14). This package does not depend on them: it tests the default with a fake source, and the real accessor plugs in without a kit change (UK-41 verifies it).
- Launch locales are English plus `de`, `fr`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `zh-Hans`; there is no RTL locale, so no RTL baselines, but layouts stay RTL-safe.

## Steps

1. Headless layer first: the models or controllers, running the UK-02b fixtures.
2. Styled parts, then the drop-in flow, against the mockups.
3. Baselines in both themes, the lint, the sample and the docs pages.
4. Design review against the mockups; record it in the PR.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every §4.1 component in scope ships in all three layers of §1.3: (a) the drop-in flow, (b) styled parts with the kit's restyle hooks (§3.2), and (c) the headless model.
- [ ] With an empty theme the kit renders the Polaris Key look (§1.1) in the product's accent; `preset: "native"` restyles it to the host (§3.4); every §3.1 theme field is honoured.
- [ ] Product identity resolves integrator → SDK presentation source → bundle → derived accent → ink (§1.2). A test with a fake presentation source (accent, `accentDark`, verified icon) renders the product accent and icon with **zero integrator code**; the kit has no discovery fetch or icon cache of its own (owner decision: one path, via HA-13/HA-14).
- [ ] Every visible string is a catalog key from UK-02a in the launch locales; the cross-kit string lint (UK-15) passes.
- [ ] Screenshot baselines exist for every fixture component × state (UK-02b) in **both dark and light**, at the sizes and variants of §7.1 for this kit, committed lossless under `packages/sdk-node/test/ink/golden/`; a changed baseline fails CI until re-recorded with the reason in the commit.
- [ ] The §7.3 modernity lint passes on this kit, including the RTL-safe layout rule (no physical left/right; no RTL baselines are required).
- [ ] The §4.4 accessibility checks pass on the same renders.
- [ ] The sample runs against the fixture adapters with no live Worker and with `--live` (§6.1).
- [ ] The kit's framework page and its tab on each component page exist in the docs `build/ui/` section (UK-16 scaffold); the kit README is install + one-line flow + link.
- [ ] A design review against the mockups is recorded in the PR (§7.4); any disagreement between mockup and spec is fixed first.
- [ ] `parity.json` for this SDK records the `ui.*` rows this kit proves (UK-02b ids), with snapshot plus fixture-run proofs.
- [ ] The green gate passes (AGENTS.md), including every drift gate listed in the header.

## Verify

```sh
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm --filter @polaris-key/node test
```

## Hand-off

None.

The role agent sets `--set UK-32 in-review` when it hands off. After review, the lead adds the last
commit of the PR: `node docs/research/2026-09-29-godot-omniplatform/program/check.mjs --set UK-32 done`.
