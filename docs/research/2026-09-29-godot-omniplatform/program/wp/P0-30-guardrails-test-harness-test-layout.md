## Consolidation 2026-10-07

Registered by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) as **CQW-16** in [Track B, Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on)](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#b-foundations-code-quality-the-feature-tracks-build-on).

## Goal

Guardrails, test harness and test layout, as scoped below. Done when every acceptance criterion holds and the green gate passes.

## Why

Filed by the [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) (2026-10-07) as **CQW-16** in [Track B, Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on)](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#b-foundations-code-quality-the-feature-tracks-build-on). The decision record is [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) (§3.2); the crosswalk from its working ids to graph ids is at the end of [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#crosswalk-integrationmd-ids-to-registered-ids). Evidence: [`audits/cq-worker-core.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/cq-worker-core.md), [`audits/cq-worker-services.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/cq-worker-services.md).

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` (always), and the skill that applies, if any.
- [Track B, Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on)](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md#b-foundations-code-quality-the-feature-tracks-build-on): the package's row, the track's dependencies and exit criteria, and the six cross-track rules at the top.
- [`integration.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) §3.2, for **CQW-16**.
- [`audits/cq-worker-core.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/cq-worker-core.md), for file and line evidence.
- [`audits/cq-worker-services.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/audits/cq-worker-services.md), for file and line evidence.

## Scope

**In:**

- noUnusedLocals/noUnusedParameters for the worker; unused-export test with an allow-list; an 800-line new-file budget; test/adminWorld.ts; makeTestDb() cloning a serialized migrated template (today 133 migrations x 643 calls); test/{core,services/<slug>,surfaces}; test:service scripts; drop HA-12's presentationInsert hack.

**Out** (and where it belongs instead):

- Work owned by the packages in the Depends on and Unblocks rows, and the rest of Track B (→ the ids in [`tracks.md`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/tracks.md)).

## Design notes

- Working id **CQW-16**; DX consolidation B: Foundations (code quality the feature tracks build on).
- No new copies (tracks.md rule 4): build on the one mechanism this plan names, never beside it.

## Steps

1. Verify this brief against the code (the code is the fact) and record any correction here, in the same branch.
2. Implement the scope; run the green gate; hand off.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Worker test wall time measurably lower
- [ ] Budget and unused-export tests blocking
- [ ] The green gate passes (`AGENTS.md`), including any drift gate this work package touches.

## Verify

```sh
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm --filter @polaris-key/worker test
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm gen:transcripts -- --check
```

Then the full green gate in `AGENTS.md`.

## Hand-off

What downstream work packages rely on from this one is named in their briefs (the Unblocks row). The role agent sets `--set P0-30 in-review` when it hands off. After review, the lead adds the last commit of the PR:
`node docs/research/2026-09-29-godot-omniplatform/program/check.mjs --set P0-30 done`.
