## Consolidation 2026-10-07

> skip it. Revive when a product ships React Native. Re-read this brief against the code before reviving it.

The [DX consolidation plan](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/README.md) records this package as **parked** in [`backlog-changes.json`](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/backlog-changes.json); the [decision record](../../../2026-10-07-dx-consolidation/integration.md) has the reasoning. This section wins over the text below where they differ.

> React Native (4-6 weeks, a native module over two SDKs). Revive when a product ships React Native.

- Optional now (was required).

## Owner direction (2026-10-08)

- **Two implementation paths.** An integrator drops in the kit or builds their own UI on the SDK. The in-app experience leads with the drop-in kit and links to the docs for integrating directly with your own UI. The docs present both paths.

## Design language v2 (2026-10-08)

This package follows the [design language](../../../../design/UI-KITS.md#design-language-v2-2026-10-08) (rules DL1–DL18). Its row of the [application matrix](../../../../design/UI-KITS-LANGUAGE-MATRIX.md):

- **Rules:** DL1–DL18 (DL14: links only; phones browse).
- **In this kit:** The shape comes from `useWindowDimensions()`, never `Platform.isPad`. RN primitives cannot draw Liquid Glass or Expressive shapes: evaluate a native view for the iOS 26 glass primary against the iOS 18 material look before choosing. `native` uses `PlatformColor` and `DynamicColorIOS`. `allowFontScaling` stays on with no multiplier cap below 2. DL9 uses `AccessibilityInfo.setAccessibilityFocus` and the hardware-keyboard ring on Android. Safe areas come from `react-native-safe-area-context`, keyboard avoidance never re-lays out the screen, and `Linking.openURL` runs behind the https check.
- **Minimum check:** Maestro or Detox on an iPhone and an Android phone (portrait and landscape), a tablet, and 200 % font, both schemes and both presets.
- **Acceptance:** the matrix rows above pass, and a UX review (`pkey-ux-reviewer`) of the built screens gives each a quality verdict of good or better.

## Screen acceptance (brand transition, 2026-10-09)

Done when every row holds for each screen and state this package ships, checked in the real runtime
(not mockups; native kits on device or simulator), with evidence paths in the PR. A row that cannot
apply says why in one line. One home: EXPERIENCE.md §7.3; kits also follow DL1–DL18.

- [ ] Keyboard: tab order follows reading order; focus always visible (DL9); no trap outside a modal;
      Escape or Cancel backs out of every overlay and step; focus returns to the opener (or the heading
      when it is gone); a route change changes the URL and moves focus to the h1, an inline mutation
      changes neither.
- [ ] Screen readers: landmarks and exactly one h1; every icon-only control named; help and errors
      linked (aria-describedby); one polite announcement per change, none while typing; tables use
      th with scope; status is a word and an icon, never colour alone.
- [ ] Sizing: this surface's UI-KITS §7.1 rows plus 200 % text and 400 % zoom (320 CSS px reflow) with
      no page-level sideways scroll; a dense table scrolls only inside a labelled, focusable region;
      targets ≥ 44 px on customer and touch surfaces, ≥ 24 px with separation in the console.
- [ ] Themes: dark and light; a custom product accent on a light and a dark ground (kits, hosted
      sign-in); forced-colors; prefers-contrast: more; reduced transparency; contrast measured on the
      render (text 4.5:1, UI 3:1).
- [ ] States: loading (skeleton after the grace), first-run empty, filtered empty, permission refused,
      expired or stale, network and API error with Try again, partial failure, success; input survives a
      failed save; where the API sends expectedVersion, a changed-since-open conflict is named with
      Reload.
- [ ] Motion: tokens only; reduced motion is an instant swap and the outcome still reads; errors appear
      without moving content; progress is real (no invented percentage, nothing loops after a failure);
      no celebration on refunds, revocation, removal, deletion or consent.
- [ ] Hierarchy and copy: one filled primary per state; the section accent marks context only, never
      success, warning or failure; copy from the catalog, each fact once; no decorative numbers or
      taglines; no text drawn over customer art.
- [ ] Native (kits): Dynamic Type or font scale at the 200 % row, VoiceOver or TalkBack, gamepad and
      D-pad focus, TV and title-safe insets, terminal keys with NO_COLOR, ascii and --json paths.
- [ ] pkey-ux-reviewer passes the built screens (BUILT mode).

## Goal

An Expo or bare React Native app gates itself with one component, and the screens follow the iOS 26 and Android idioms of §1.4.

## Why

React Native is a should row of §5.1; it reuses the React hooks and ui-core, and needs a native module because the JS SDK cannot hold keychain-grade storage on device. The spec is [`docs/design/UI-KITS.md`](../../../../design/UI-KITS.md); its "Owner decisions (2026-10-05)" header wins over the sections below it.

## Read first

- `AGENTS.md` (always) and `CLAUDE.md`.
- [UI-KITS.md](../../../../design/UI-KITS.md) §1.4 iOS and Android rows, §5.1, §6.1
- `packages/sdk-react/`, `sdks/swift`, `sdks/kotlin`

## Scope

**In:**

- Hooks over ui-core; RN screens and sheets in RN primitives, platform-adaptive.
- A native module bridging the Swift and Kotlin SDKs (storage, fingerprint, sign-in hand-off).
- Expo sample (iOS and Android).

**Out** (and where it belongs instead):

- Web rendering (→ UK-05).

## Design notes

- Presentation comes only through the core's `ProductIdentity` seam from the SDK (HA-13, HA-14). This package does not depend on them: it tests the default with a fake source, and the real accessor plugs in without a kit change (UK-41 verifies it).
- Launch locales are English plus `de`, `fr`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `zh-Hans`; there is no RTL locale, so no RTL baselines, but layouts stay RTL-safe.

## Steps

1. Headless layer first: the models or controllers, running the UK-02b fixtures.
2. Styled parts, then the drop-in flow, against the mockups.
3. Baselines in both themes, the lint, the sample and the docs pages.
4. Design review against the mockups; record it in the PR.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every §4.1 component in scope ships in all three layers of §1.3: (a) the drop-in flow, (b) styled parts with the kit's restyle hooks (§3.2), and (c) the headless model.
- [ ] With an empty theme the kit renders the Polaris Key look (§1.1) in the product's accent; `preset: "native"` restyles it to the host (§3.4); every §3.1 theme field is honoured.
- [ ] Product identity resolves integrator → SDK presentation source → bundle → derived accent → ink (§1.2). A test with a fake presentation source (accent, `accentDark`, verified icon) renders the product accent and icon with **zero integrator code**; the kit has no discovery fetch or icon cache of its own (owner decision: one path, via HA-13/HA-14).
- [ ] Every visible string is a catalog key from UK-02a in the launch locales; the cross-kit string lint (UK-15) passes.
- [ ] Screenshot baselines exist for every fixture component × state (UK-02b) in **both dark and light**, at the sizes and variants of §7.1 for this kit, committed lossless under `packages/react-native/test/visual/`; a changed baseline fails CI until re-recorded with the reason in the commit.
- [ ] The §7.3 modernity lint passes on this kit, including the RTL-safe layout rule (no physical left/right; no RTL baselines are required).
- [ ] The §4.4 accessibility checks pass on the same renders.
- [ ] The sample `examples/ui/expo/` runs against the fixture adapters with no live Worker and with `--live` (§6.1).
- [ ] The kit's framework page and its tab on each component page exist in the docs `build/ui/` section (UK-16 scaffold); the kit README is install + one-line flow + link.
- [ ] A design review against the mockups (`ios.html`, `android.html`) is recorded in the PR (§7.4); any disagreement between mockup and spec is fixed first.
- [ ] `parity.json` for this SDK records the `ui.*` rows this kit proves (UK-02b ids), with snapshot plus fixture-run proofs.
- [ ] The acceptance in "Design language v2 (2026-10-08)" above holds.
- [ ] The green gate passes (AGENTS.md), including every drift gate listed in the header.

## Verify

```sh
mise exec node@22 -- pnpm --filter @polaris-key/react-native test

## Hand-off

None.

The role agent sets `--set UK-20 in-review` when it hands off. After review, the lead adds the last
commit of the PR: `node docs/research/2026-09-29-godot-omniplatform/program/check.mjs --set UK-20 done`.
