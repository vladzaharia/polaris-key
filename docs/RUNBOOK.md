# Polaris Key operations runbook

This runbook is for operating an already deployed Polaris Key production service at
`https://key.plrs.im`.

For first-time production bootstrap, external provider setup, secret loading, CI setup, and
DJDL onboarding, use [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Production shape

Reserved platform routes:

- `/manage/*` - admin SPA, admin OIDC, and admin JSON API.
- `/api/*`, `/login`, `/callback`, `/logout`, `/magic/verify`, `/download/*` - customer
  portal.
- `/webhooks/github` - signed GitHub App push webhooks.
- `/<product>/*` - product-scoped licensing, config, OIDC activation, releases, and JWKS.

## Deploy

Manual deploy:

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm lint
cd packages/worker
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply polaris_key_prod --env prod --remote
npx wrangler deploy --env prod
```

CI deploy:

```sh
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

Only semver-like `v*` tags deploy production. Pushes to `main` run CI but do not deploy.

Smoke checks:

```sh
curl -fsS https://key.plrs.im/manage >/dev/null
curl -fsS https://key.plrs.im/api/capabilities | jq .
```

## Secrets

Required prod Worker secrets:

```text
KEY_HASH_PEPPER
ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET
PORTAL_SESSION_SECRET
PLATFORM_KEK
PLATFORM_ADMIN_GROUP=admin
PLATFORM_OIDC_ISSUER=https://id.plrs.im
PLATFORM_OIDC_CLIENT_ID
PLATFORM_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET
GITHUB_APP_ID
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

Rotate or set a Worker secret:

```sh
cd packages/worker
npx wrangler secret put <NAME> --env prod
```

`PLATFORM_KEK` protects sealed product signing keys and product secrets in D1. Rotating it
requires a deliberate re-encryption migration; do not rotate it as a routine secret.

Product secrets are not Worker secrets. Set them through the admin UI/API so they are sealed
into `product_secrets`; values are write-only and never echoed back.

## Product operations

Register products through the admin portal repo-link flow when a product repo has `.pkey/`
files. Manual product creation is only for early experiments before release/OIDC/provisioning
exists.

For DJDL, confirm:

- `.pkey/product` uses `oidc.provider: platform`.
- Redirect URI is `https://key.plrs.im/djdl/auth/callback`.
- Admin group is `admin`.
- Required product secrets are configured:
  - `EDGE_MINT__DJDL__APPLEMUSIC`

Product validation:

```sh
curl -fsS https://key.plrs.im/djdl/.well-known/polaris.json | jq .
curl -fsS https://key.plrs.im/djdl/.well-known/jwks.json | jq .
curl -fsS https://key.plrs.im/djdl/schema | jq .
curl -fsS https://key.plrs.im/djdl/appcast.xml >/dev/null
```

Use the Releases view to inspect GitHub sync status, changed `.pkey/` paths, manifest
validation errors, and release health. Use manual resync there when a webhook was missed.

## CI gates

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on PRs and `main` pushes:

- JS/TS build, typecheck, tests, lint.
- Conformance corpus drift check with `pnpm gen:corpus -- --check`.
- Admin build.
- Python SDK tests on Ubuntu and macOS.
- Swift SDK tests on macOS.

A red conformance job means the wire contract changed without regenerating and committing
the corpus.

## Troubleshooting

Admin login fails before redirect:

- Check `PLATFORM_OIDC_ISSUER`, `PLATFORM_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, and
  `PLATFORM_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- Confirm the PocketID platform client allows `https://key.plrs.im/manage/callback`.

Admin login succeeds but access is denied:

- Confirm the ID token includes a string-array `groups` claim.
- Confirm your PocketID user belongs to `admins`.
- Confirm `PLATFORM_ADMIN_GROUP=admin`.

Portal magic links are hidden:

- Confirm at least one product has portal and magic links enabled.
- Confirm prod deployed with the `EMAIL` send binding.
- Confirm Cloudflare Email Service allows `noreply@plrs.im`.

DJDL OIDC activation fails with `platform oidc is not configured`:

- Check `PLATFORM_OIDC_ISSUER` and `PLATFORM_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`.

Custom-product OIDC activation fails with `oidc client secret unavailable`:

- Set the product secret named by that product's `oidc.clientSecretSecret`.

Repo-link or release sync cannot access GitHub:

- Confirm GitHub App `polaris-key` is installed on the product repo.
- Confirm Worker secrets `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, and
  `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- Confirm the app has Contents: read and Actions: read.

Deploy fails on bindings:

- Confirm `REPLACE_ME_PROD_D1_ID` and `REPLACE_ME_PROD_KV_ID` in
  `packages/worker/wrangler.toml` have been replaced with real Cloudflare IDs.
