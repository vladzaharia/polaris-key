/**
 * The service registry — how Core mounts a Polaris service (design spec §5.1, D-02).
 *
 * The worker is a modular monolith, split-ready: one Cloudflare Worker containing an
 * always-on `core/` substrate plus one directory per opt-in service. Adding a service is
 * meant to be exactly two things — a directory and a descriptor — with nothing in Core
 * needing to learn the new service's name.
 *
 * Core owns dispatch, and dispatch is where enablement is enforced. A service that a product
 * has not enabled does not "return an error"; from the outside it does not exist. That is the
 * same hide-don't-reveal posture the rest of the worker already takes for unknown products:
 * an unauthenticated prober must not be able to map which products run which services.
