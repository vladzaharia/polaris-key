# Changelog

All notable changes to the Polaris Key Godot addon (`addons/polaris_key`). Versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org/); before 1.0 a minor version may change the API. One version is one
value in four places: `plugin.cfg`'s `version`, `PolarisKey.SDK_VERSION` (also sent as
`X-PKey-SDK-Version`), the release tag `godot-vX.Y.Z` and the zip's name. The release workflow
(`.github/workflows/release-godot.yml`) uses the section below whose heading is the tag's version
as the GitHub Release notes, and the same text is the Asset Store version's changelog.

## Unreleased

The SDK parity pass (`notes/SDK-PARITY-PASS.md` §5.6).

- **Behaviour change: `license.is_entitled(name)` answers `false` whenever the gate is not
  usable** (S-19 G11). A revoked, expired or blocked licence no longer unlocks a grant its last
  verified document still lists. `get_entitlements()` still reads the raw values.

## 0.1.0

The first published version. Requires Godot 4.4 or later (4.6 or later recommended). Tested on
4.4.1, 4.5.2, 4.6.3 and 4.7.2.

- **Core, in pure GDScript.** Ed25519, SHA-512 and the 13-step compact-JWS verify (the engine has
  neither primitive), strict JSON pre-validation, the pinned trust manifest, the clock floor, the
  verified offline cache, bundle import and `sync()`, behind the `PolarisKey` autoload. Passes
  the same conformance corpus as the Node, React, Python and Swift SDKs, in the editor and on an
  exported release template.
- **Services.** `PolarisKey.license` (activation, enrolment, deactivation, entitlements),
  `config` (managed config with the shared precedence, the `PKEY_CONFIG_*` environment layer,
  secrets, edge-mint, `config_changed`), `devices` (fingerprint, keyless registration, the
  roster), `identity` (device-code sign-in with a QR code), `update` (the signed channel feed and
  release record, the update decision, acting on it per outlet, the sidecar-PCK swap and the boot
  guard) and `release` (changelog, install and download URLs). `PolarisKey.supports(feature)`
  answers what works on this platform, with a reason.
- **Boot and UI kit.** `await PolarisKey.boot()` runs the shared boot stage machine with the
  drop-in `PKeyBoot` scene; the gate, activation, sign-in, offline, settings, status-banner,
  update-prompt, entitlement-badge and dev-menu scenes are themeable, translatable and
  gamepad-navigable, and centre themselves from a phone in portrait to 4K. Their default look is
  neutral (your game's theme and font, no Polaris Key branding); `ui_branding = "polaris-key"`
  opts into the Polaris Key design system (dark or light, Rubik under the OFL, the Pinned K), and
  `ui_powered_by` adds the "Powered by Polaris Key" badge (off by default).
- **Packs.** `PolarisKey.update.packs` installs `godot.pck` and `files.tree` releases (deltas
  through the engine's own decoder on 4.6+, chunk sync, revocations, content-key delegation),
  checks every pack's directory before it is committed or mounted, and mounts packs at a boot.
- **Editor.** The setup dock writes `res://polaris_key.tres` and checks the pinned keys against
  the live trust manifest; the export plugin stamps every export (`res://.polaris_key/build.json`
  and the `pkey_*` feature tags) with CI overrides through `PKEY_BUILD_*`.
- **Native plugins, optional.** `PKeyApple` (iOS) and `PKeyAndroid` facades answer a typed
  "unsupported" without their native halves, so the addon runs everywhere without them; the
  native builds are not part of this zip.
- **Brand.** The setup dock's tab carries the Polaris Key glyph (Godot 4.6+), and
  `addons/polaris_key/brand/` holds the "Powered by Polaris Key" credit screens and badges for a
  game's credits.
